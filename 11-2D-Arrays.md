### Context
Given a  2D Array, _A_:

```txt
1 1 1 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
```

We define an hourglass in _A_ to be a subset of values with indices falling in this pattern in _A_'s graphical representation:

```txt
a b c
  d
e f g
```

There are  hourglasses in _A_, and an hourglass sum is the sum of an hourglass' values.

### Task
Calculate the hourglass sum for every hourglass in _A_, then print the maximum hourglass sum.

### Example

In the array shown above, the maximum hourglass sum is _7_ for the hourglass in the top left corner.

### Input Format

There are _6_ lines of input, where each line contains _6_ space-separated integers that describe the 2D Array _A_.

### Constraints

- -9<=A[i][j]<=9
- 0<=i,j<=5

### Output Format

Print the maximum hourglass sum in _A_.

### Sample Input

```txt

1 1 1 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 2 4 4 0
0 0 0 2 0 0
0 0 1 2 4 0

```

### Sample Output

```txt

19

```
